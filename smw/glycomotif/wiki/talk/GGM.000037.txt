Motif modified to remove the initial Gal which is not required for N-linked structures to have this determinant. New GlyTouCan accession is [[GM.G94956AW|G94956AW]], old one was [[GM.G34881WK|G34881WK]]. This also brings this motif into line with other Type 2 blood group motifs (which can be found on N-linked structures).
