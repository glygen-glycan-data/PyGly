Corrected from Cummings reference, to have two GlcNAc residues at core. Original GlyTouCan accession G54792LL.

Also corrected to put the phosphate on the 6-arm of the 6-linked mannose, consistent with figure 1 of Cummings.

Note that the name of this motif is quite misleading, per the citation (#39, Dahms et al. 2008) from Cummings, Man-6-P refers to the linkage of the phosphate, not the number of mannose residues. Also, it is unclear why diphosphate and the Man6 N-linked structure is the only one in the Cummings table, as the citation shows Man9 with up to 5 possible mannose placements for the (single) phosphate (Figure 1).
