Collections of glycan determinants and motifs sourced from many different glycoinformatics resources. Links to original data resources and contact details provided on each motif collection page. 

The [[GGM|GlyGen motif collection]] is under active development and curation and is integrated with the [http://glygen.org GlyGen: Computational and Informatics Resources for Glycoscience] site. 

Many of the collections, including GlyGen's, were originally derived from Cummings (2009), "[[Cummings_(2009)_The_repertoire_of_glycan_determinants_in_the_human_glycome|The repertoire of glycan determinants in the human glycome]]." The GlyGen motifs are annotated with citations extracted from Cummings (2009). 

The [[GM|All Motifs collection]] represents the union of the collections, integrated on the basis of the GlyTouCan accession describing the motif structure. The All Motifs motif pages also include tools for exploring related motifs, with the same topology, or with the addition or removal of monosaccharides from the nonreducing or reducing end. 

All motifs from all collections are aligned with the bulk of GlyTouCan structures on a regular basis, according to each motif's alignment annotation. GlycoMotif supports [[Substructure Alignment|substructure]], [[Glycan Core Alignment|glycan core]], [[Nonreducing-End Alignment|nonreducing end]], and [[Whole-Glycan Alignment|whole-glycan]] motif alignments. All motif annotations and their alignments are available for [[Download|download]] from the GlycoMotif triple-store. 

'''NEW!''' GlycoMotif, and the on-demand motif alignment web-service, now support motifs and structures with repeating elements. We hope to use this to help identify and classify GAGs for GlyGen. Note that only substructure and glycan core motif alignments are supported for glycans with repeating elements. Examples: [[GGM.000004|i antigen]] and [[GGM.001206|a putative GAG core]].
