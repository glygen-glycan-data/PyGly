{{Class
|definition=High-mannose N-linked glycan subtype determined by core alignment to the N-Glycan core basic motif ([[GGM.001001]]), plus checks to ensure all residues, except for two reducing end GlcNAc, are Man. The additional motif ([[GGM.001002]]) is included for historical reasons, but does not result in any additional structures.
